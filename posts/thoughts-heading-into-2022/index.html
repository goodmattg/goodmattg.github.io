Building a network effect through your community is becoming a key marker of success. This much is obvious and written to death in thinkpieces. Tools to actually support that community, to make it more enjoyeable for them to participate are still growing. Think about how Discord went from gaming chat, to the defacto community management platform for web3 / bleeding-edge software projects.</p><p>As developers we build these things we think are great&mldr; and then they go nowhere. You&rsquo;re either in the situtation where the thing you made is really that much better than the thing that came before it - the true 10x better case. Great, good for you. Your project is so badly needed or cool it will instantly gain adoption. But in the case where your advantage is only marginal&mldr; what to do exactly? It is painfully difficult to market your product.</p><p>Part of what we forget is that we are all players in an industry. It is a <em>luxury</em> for western developers to talk about &ldquo;playing&rdquo; with new languages in their &ldquo;free time&rdquo;. Free time - time away from the burdens of life and working to survive is a luxury that comes much easily in developing nations. You may have free time, but optimizing that free time is given more care than it is Silicon XYZ.</p><p>You find framework Alpha and you think and think it may be part of the future, so you decide to do a side project using Alpha. This isn&rsquo;t truly <em>play</em> - it&rsquo;s calculated. You probably enjoy programming, and will probably find some enjoyment in trying Alpha, but let&rsquo;s get serious. There is some probability that Alpha blows up, and being in front of the trend makes you more valuable. We all want to maximize our value professionally - so it pays to pick a winner.</p><p>What&rsquo;s my point here? There is a gap in the market. Gaming companies pay gaming influencers to play their games. The same incentives don&rsquo;t existing for software projects / companies (yet). Only large companies have &ldquo;developer advocates&rdquo; on staff. Closing the loop is making it easier to for people to demonstrate that they know your tool is valuable for their own recruiting.</p><p>But I hate this idea of &ldquo;credentialing&rdquo; institutions like Coursera that give you a micro-certificate for completing some course - and now they charge you for it.</p></div></div><div id=footer class=mb-5><script src=https://utteranc.es/client.js repo=goodmattg/goodmattg.github.io issue-term=pathname label=blog theme=github-light crossorigin=anonymous async></script><hr><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://goodmattg.github.io><small>By Matthew Goodman</small></a></div></div></body></html>
