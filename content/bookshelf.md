## An attempt to track my reading (incomplete)

Book | Author | Started | Finished | Notes 
-----|-------|-------|-------|--------
How To Change Your Mind | Michael Pollan  | 03/23/21 |  | 
Red Sorghum | Mo Yan | 7/14/20 | | That this won him the Nobel Prize is no longer suprising.

Master of the Senate | Robert Caro | 1/12/20 | | 
The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right | Atul Gawande | 11/25/19 | | 
Range: Why Generalists Triumph in A Specialized World | David Epstein |  | 09/15/19 | A must-read for anyone in the early stages of their career that feels anxiety seeing friends around them rocket to the top of a narrow sub-domain. The good news is that a bright future awaits generalists later in their careers. The generalists are able to make leaps out of their narrow sub-domains, drawing on ideas from fields that would look on the surface as having nothing to do with their current problem, but yet, as it turns out do share the same substructure. I love this book because it reminds you that, yes, you can be great at things you didn't start practicing when you were four. However, I think Epstein doesn't spend enough time exploring why generalists are disappearing in our late-stage capitalist world. This isn't a personal book. Epstein may credit that students are forced to specialize early, but he isn't really thinking about the emotional and psychological side of early-specialization.
Man's Search For Meaning | Victor Frankl | 6/10/19 | | Profound.
The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google | Scott Galloway  | | 05/23/19 | Professor Scott Galloway's treatise on the four tech giants of our age is incendiary and prophetic. I blitzed through Galloway's book on a flight from Austin to New York and couldn't escape the thought that my life is textbook confirmation of his thesis. I read The Four on an iPad during a flight that I priced with Google. I had just purchased a bunch of basics in bulk for my new apartment from Amazon on a MacBook. Facebook should go without saying - I'm under 25, so I compulsively check Messenger and Instagram. The Four almost exclusively dominate my interactions with my friends, peers, and family. And while this should be cause for privacy concerns, I likely won't act until the risks, which are not readily apparent, outweigh the enormous benefits. We pay for free connection, free search, and the ability to cheaply acquire every product in existence with our data. It's easy react negatively to handing over so much data to large companies: "it's my data, how dare they monetize it ...." but that's quite literally the price of free services. Where I get angry is when legacy companies acquire my data, usually from shady third party data providers - hotels, credit agencies, etc. Legacy companies = terrible security. They don't have the vested interest or the technical ability to maintain a state-of-the-art security operation. At least Google has never suffered a major data breach. It speaks to my biases/preferences/experience, but when I rent a storage unit my main concern is that the unit is secure from theft. I rarely consider if the storage proprietor has checked to see what I have stored in the locker. And a key technical point to remember in the case of every digital storage provider is that any these companies don't just stored your data in plain sight. There isn't a file of "Matt_personal_data.txt" on a database somewhere. This information is all encrypted and then sharded a thousand ways to Sunday because the companies themselves have a vested interest to protect your data from adversaries.
