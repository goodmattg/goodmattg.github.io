## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

Experienced software engineer primarily focused on applied machine learning. I’m specialized in distributed AutoML services and deep-learning based computer vision.

My professional experience is mainly in C/C++, Python, and Scala and spans the software engineering stack from platform engineering to algorithm development.

In my free time I enjoy exploring new languages (Rust/Haskell/Erlang), and taking on quantitative challenges. I’ve completed projects in a wide variety of domains including quantitative finance, natural language processing, and Bayesian statistical modeling.

>“Don’t aim at success—the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one’s dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one’s surrender to a person other than oneself.”
