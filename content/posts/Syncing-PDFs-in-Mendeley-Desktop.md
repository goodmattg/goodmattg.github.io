Mendeley is a great tool to keep track of papers and citations across multiple devices if you can figure out how to actually enable file (i.e. PDF) syncing across devices. The UX designers were on a lunch break when this one was cooked up. The good news: enabling syncing is easy and you'll never have to think about it again:

### Step 1) Open Mendeley Desktop

To my knowledge, the sync files across devices setting can only be configured from Mendeley Desktop. So if you're trying to sync between a desktop and several mobile devices you'll need to open Mendeley Desktop on your desktop.

### Step 2) Open the "Edit Settings" Menu

Click "Edit Settings" to get into the Edit Settings menu. This is probably the most confusing step. Normally, settings are configured via the Preferences menu, but Mendeley chose to include a standalone Edit Settings menu.

### Step 3) Check "Synchronize Attached Files"

Check the "Synchronize Attached Files" checkbox. Use the checkboxes below to configure which files (PDFs) you want to keep synced across devices. Mendeley will watch these folders and upload any new papers to the cloud as soon as you add them.

### Step 4) Click "Save and Sync"

Click "Save and Sync" at the bottom of the menu to lock in your setting changes.

### Step 5) Enjoy

The sync should start immediately and your files (PDFs) should be accessible across all devices.
