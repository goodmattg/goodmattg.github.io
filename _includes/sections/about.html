<div>
        My name is Matthew Goodman. I currently work at Qualtrics as a Software Engineer on the Digital Experience Platform team. I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2017 with a major in Electrical Engineering and minors in both Math and Computer Science. My interests are varied: deep learning for computer vision, reinforcement learning, probability theory, functional programming, signal processing, political science, philosophy, history, trading, network theory, foreign policy, art, design, finance, and the general nitty gritty of technology. The content of this blog will reflect the fact that, while I am by no means an expert in any of these subjects, I'm consistently gaining knowledge in them over time.
