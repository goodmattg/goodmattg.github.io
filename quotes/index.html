Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“They killed, they looted, and they defended their country in a valiant, stirring ballet that makes us unfilial descendants who now occupy the land pale by comparison. Surrounded by progress, I feel a nagging sense of our species’ regression”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Moawad, Trevor. “It Takes What It Takes.” HarperCollins, 2019-11-25. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“You need to be thinking neutrally, making plans, and making good choices so you’re prepared when the pressure arrives. Someone is going to get what you want. It’s up to you to make sure that person is you. You can behave your way into being ready even if you don’t have the perfect God-given skill set for your situation. Someone else having a gift that you don’t have isn’t a valid excuse.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Moawad, Trevor. “It Takes What It Takes.” HarperCollins, 2019-11-25. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“Are we for real? If I’m doing what I’ve intended to do in the manner it is supposed to be done, then I’m absolutely for fucking real. For the best at anything, the real pressure happens inside—not externally. But everyone is swimming in that dark ocean. Fear is real. Believe it. Still, we can all swim if we are willing to learn. And on the back side of accomplishment is a feeling that you can’t buy. You can’t snort it or take a pill for it. You earn it. Because you did it or you were a part of a team that did it.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Moawad, Trevor. “It Takes What It Takes.” HarperCollins, 2019-11-25. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“The SEALs say that you are never out of the fight. This applies to so much more than combat deployment. Conscious competence is knowing how to do what you need to do when you need to do it and why you are doing it. It gives us the ability to be dependable. To be consistent.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Robert A. Caro. “Master of the Senate.” Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2009-07-22. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“Debate was about goals, issues, about “principled things.” “It is the politician’s task to pass legislation, not to sit around saying principled things,” he said, repeating that credo over and over”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Robert A. Caro. “Master of the Senate.” Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2009-07-22. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“The most important thing he has to say is what he’s trying not to say.” For that reason, he told them, it was important to keep the man talking; the longer he talked, the more likely he was to let slip a hint of that vulnerability he was so anxious to conceal. “That’s why he wouldn’t let a conversation end,” Busby explains. “If he saw the other fellow was trying not to say something, he wouldn’t let it [the conversation] end until he got it out of him.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Robert A. Caro. “Master of the Senate.” Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2009-07-22. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“Read eyes. No matter what a man is saying to you, it’s not as important as what you can read in his eyes”—and to read between the lines: more interested in men’s weaknesses than in their strengths because it was weakness that could be exploited, he tried to teach his assistants how to learn a man’s weakness.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Robert A. Caro. “Master of the Senate.” Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2009-07-22. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“I shall ever thank God that in that troubled hour of trial, when many privately confessed that they had sacrificed their judgment and their conscience at the behests of party newspapers and party hate, I had the courage to be true to my oath and my conscience.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Atul, Gawande. “The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right.” Metropolitan Books, 2010-04-01T07:00:00+00:00. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“People need room to act and adapt. Yet they cannot succeed as isolated individuals, either—that is anarchy. Instead, they require a seemingly contradictory mix of freedom and expectation—expectation to coordinate, for example, and also to measure progress toward common goals.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Atul, Gawande. “The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right.” Metropolitan Books, 2010-04-01T07:00:00+00:00. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“In the face of the unknown—the always nagging uncertainty about whether, under complex circumstances, things will really be okay—the builders trusted in the power of communication. They didn’t believe in the wisdom of the single individual, of even an experienced engineer. They believed in the wisdom of the group, the wisdom of making sure that multiple pairs of eyes were on a problem and then letting the watchers decide what to do. Man is fallible, but maybe men are less so.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Atul, Gawande. “The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right.” Metropolitan Books, 2010-04-01T07:00:00+00:00. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“Avoidable failures are common and persistent, not to mention demoralizing and frustrating, across many fields—from medicine to finance, business to government. And the reason is increasingly evident: the volume and complexity of what we know has exceeded our individual ability to deliver its benefits correctly, safely, or reliably. Knowledge has both saved us and burdened us.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Atul, Gawande. “The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right.” Metropolitan Books, 2010-04-01T07:00:00+00:00. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“For nearly all of history, people’s lives have been governed primarily by ignorance. This was nowhere more clear than with the illnesses that befell us. We knew little about what caused them or what could be done to remedy them. But sometime over the last several decades—and it is only over the last several decades—science has filled in enough knowledge to make ineptitude as much our struggle as ignorance.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Viktor E. Frankl. “Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning.” Beacon Press, 2006-06-02T00:00:00+00:00. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“Don’t aim at success—the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one’s dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one’s surrender to a person other than oneself.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Viktor E. Frankl. “Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning.” Beacon Press, 2006-06-02T00:00:00+00:00. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“Or for instance, a light sleeper, who used to be disturbed by the slightest noise in the next room, now found himself lying pressed against a comrade who snored loudly a few inches from his ear and yet slept quite soundly through the noise.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Viktor E. Frankl. “Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning.” Beacon Press, 2006-06-02T00:00:00+00:00. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of man is through love and in love. I”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Viktor E. Frankl. “Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning.” Beacon Press, 2006-06-02T00:00:00+00:00. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“Dostoevski said once, “There is only one thing that I dread: not to be worthy of my sufferings.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Viktor E. Frankl. “Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning.” Beacon Press, 2006-06-02T00:00:00+00:00. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“An active life serves the purpose of giving man the opportunity to realize values in creative work, while a passive life of enjoyment affords him the opportunity to obtain fulfillment in experiencing beauty, art, or nature. But there is also purpose in that life which is almost barren of both creation and enjoyment and which admits of but one possibility of high moral behavior: namely, in man’s attitude to his existence, an existence restricted by external forces”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Viktor E. Frankl. “Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning.” Beacon Press, 2006-06-02T00:00:00+00:00. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity—even under the most difficult circumstances—to add a deeper meaning to his life. It may remain brave, dignified and unselfish. Or in the bitter fight for self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal. Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that a difficult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Viktor E. Frankl. “Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning.” Beacon Press, 2006-06-02T00:00:00+00:00. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“What does Spinoza say in his Ethics? —“Affectus, qui passio est, desinit esse passio simulatque eius claram et distinctam formamus ideam.” Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Galloway, Scott. “The Four.” Penguin Publishing Group, 2017-10-03. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“In sum, it’s never been a better time to be exceptional, or a worse time to be average.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Galloway, Scott. “The Four.” Penguin Publishing Group, 2017-10-03. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“Young people who have a strong sense of their own identity, remain poised under stress, and learn and apply what they’ve learned, do better than peers who are more easily flustered, get hung up on petty issues, and let their emotions drive their responses to stimuli.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Galloway, Scott. “The Four.” Penguin Publishing Group, 2017-10-03. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“Familiarity breeds contempt. External hires are paid nearly 20 percent more than company veterans at the same level, despite receiving lower performance evaluations and still being more likely to quit.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Galloway, Scott. “The Four.” Penguin Publishing Group, 2017-10-03. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“Sectors are asset classes—the cool ones are overinvested, driving down returns on human capital (compensation for working there). If you want to work for Vogue, produce films, or open a restaurant, you had better get immense psychological reward from your gig, as the comp, and returns on your efforts, will likely suck. Competition will be fierce, and even if you manage to get in, you’ll be easily replaceable, as there are always younger, hipper candidates nipping at your heels.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Galloway, Scott. “The Four.” Penguin Publishing Group, 2017-10-03. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“The slope of the trajectory for your career is (unfairly) set the first five years post-graduation. If you want the trajectory to be steep, you’ll need to burn a lot of fuel. The world is not yours for the taking, but for the trying. Try hard, really hard.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Caro, Robert A. “The power broker : Robert Moses and the fall of New York.” New York : Vintage Books, 1975. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>My conclusions on this difficult question of democracy versus education in the civil service are these &mldr; In a sense it is a cruel thing to set up class distinctions—even if they only be intellectual. But where does our sympathy lead us? Can the state repair the defects of heredity or of early education? Can it endow the average individual with the intelligence, acuteness and cultivation which economic exigencies have denied him? . . . There should be no social bar to promotion from the lowest to the highest place—but let us not fool ourselzwxves. When we have made every possible provision for the encouragement of early promise, when we have prepared every child as far as possible for its suitable vocation, the subordinate employees of the government . . . who are fit to rise above the ranks will be few and far between.</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Caro, Robert A. “The power broker : Robert Moses and the fall of New York.” New York : Vintage Books, 1975. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“Most important, the study found that the Governor possessed little real authority. Not he but the chairmen of the various committees of the reactionary and corrupt Legislature controlled the state&rsquo;s purse. The document that was called a state budget was actually a collection of appropriations drawn up by these chairmen. No legislator—or any other state official— reviewed the collection, balanced one appropriation against another, cut them down to agreed-upon necessities or measured them against estimated revenue. Even after the document was formally printed, individual legislators continued to introduce their own &ldquo;private&rdquo; bills, generally for pork-barrel public works projects, which required public expenditures, and these, when passed, did not even”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Mukherjee, Siddhartha. “The Emperor of All Maladies.” Scribner, 2010. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“In 1884, at the prime of his career in New York, Halsted read a paper describing the use of a new surgical anesthetic called cocaine. At Halle, in Volkmann’s clinic, he had watched German surgeons perform operations using this drug; it was cheap, accessible, foolproof, and easy to dose—the fast food of surgical anesthesia. His experimental curiosity aroused, Halsted began to inject himself with the drug, testing it before using it to numb patients for his ambitious surgeries.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Mukherjee, Siddhartha. “The Emperor of All Maladies.” Scribner, 2010. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“karkinos, from the Greek word for “crab.” The tumor, with its clutch of swollen blood vessels around it, reminded Hippocrates of a crab dug in the sand with its legs spread in a circle. The image was peculiar (few cancers truly resemble crabs), but also vivid”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Mukherjee, Siddhartha. “The Emperor of All Maladies.” Scribner, 2010. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“Virchow called these two modes hyperplasia and hypertrophy. In hypertrophy, the number of cells did not change; instead, each individual cell merely grew in size—like a balloon being blown up. Hyperplasia, in contrast, was growth by virtue of cells increasing in number. Every”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Mukherjee, Siddhartha. “The Emperor of All Maladies.” Scribner, 2010. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“Blood tests performed by Carla’s doctor had revealed that her red cell count was critically low, less than a third of normal. Instead of normal white cells, her blood was packed with millions of large, malignant white cells—blasts, in the vocabulary of cancer. Her doctor, having finally stumbled upon the real diagnosis, had sent her to the Massachusetts General Hospital”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Mukherjee, Siddhartha. “The Emperor of All Maladies.” Scribner, 2010. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“In the end, cancer truly emerges, as a nineteenth-century surgeon once wrote in a book’s frontispiece, as “the emperor of all maladies, the king of terrors.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Goggins, David. “Can&rsquo;t Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds.” Lioncrest Publishing, 2018-12-04T08:00:00+00:00. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“At first, when you push beyond your perceived capability your mind won’t shut the fuck up about it. It wants you to stop so it sends you into a spin cycle of panic and doubt, which only amplifies your self-torture. But when you persist past that to the point that pain fully saturates the mind, you become single-pointed. The external world zeroes out. Boundaries dissolve and you feel connected to yourself, and to all things, in the depth of your soul”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Polya, G. “How to Solve It.” Princeton University Press. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“They often follow Polya’s wise advice: “If you can’t solve a problem, then there is an easier problem you can’t solve: find it.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Goggins, David. “Can&rsquo;t Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds.” Lioncrest Publishing, 2018-12-04T08:00:00+00:00. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“Our culture has become hooked on the quick-fix, the life hack, efficiency. Everyone is on the hunt for that simple action algorithm that nets maximum profit with the least amount of effort. There’s no denying this attitude may get you some of the trappings of success, if you’re lucky, but it will not lead to a calloused mind or self-mastery. If you want to master the mind and remove your governor, you’ll have to become addicted to hard work. Because passion and obsession, even talent, are only useful tools if you have the work ethic to back them up”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Goggins, David. “Can&rsquo;t Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds.” Lioncrest Publishing, 2018-12-04T08:00:00+00:00. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“In a society where mediocrity is too often the standard and too often rewarded,” he said, “there is intense fascination with men who detest mediocrity, who refuse to define themselves in conventional terms, and who seek to transcend traditionally recognized human capabilities. This is exactly the type of person BUD/S is meant to find. The man who finds a way to complete each and every task to the best of his ability. The man who will adapt and overcome any and all obstacles.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Scott, Aaronson. “Quantum Computing since Democritus.” Cambridge University Press, 2013-02-27T21:00:00+00:00. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“Quantum mechanics is a beautiful generalization of the laws of probability: a generalization based on the 2-norm rather than the 1-norm, and on complex numbers rather than nonnegative real numbers. It can be studied completely separately from its applications to physics (and indeed, doing so provides a good starting point for learning the physical applications later). This generalized probability theory leads naturally to a new model of computation – the quantum computing model – that challenges ideas about computation once considered a priori, and that theoretical computer scientists might have been driven to invent for their own purposes, even if there were no relation to physics. In short, while quantum mechanics was invented a century ago to solve technical problems in physics, today it can be fruitfully explained from an extremely different perspective: as part of the history of ideas, in math, logic, computation, and philosophy, about the limits of the knowable.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Scott, Aaronson. “Quantum Computing since Democritus.” Cambridge University Press, 2013-02-27T21:00:00+00:00. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“These axioms – called the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms – are the foundation for basically all of math. So I thought you should see them at least once in your life”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Mukherjee, Siddhartha. “The Gene.” Scribner. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“The desire to homogenize and “normalize” humans must be counterbalanced against biological imperatives to maintain diversity and abnormalcy. Normalcy is the antithesis of evolution”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Mukherjee, Siddhartha. “The Gene.” Scribner. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“Even the two most extreme human variants—male and female—share 99.688 percent of their genes.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Mukherjee, Siddhartha. “The Gene.” Scribner. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“We of the craft are all crazy,” Lord Byron, the high priest of crazies, wrote. “Some are affected by gaiety, others by melancholy, but all are more or less touched.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Mukherjee, Siddhartha. “The Gene.” Scribner. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“We do not know why certain genes are located in particular geographic locations in the genome, and how the tracts of DNA that lie between genes regulate and coordinate gene physiology. There are codes beyond codes, like mountains beyond mountains”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Mukherjee, Siddhartha. “The Gene.” Scribner. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“In the proverbial story, the oracle at Delphi is asked to consider a boat on a river whose planks have begun to rot. As the wood decays, each plank is replaced, one by one—and after a decade, no plank is left from the original boat. Yet, the owner is convinced that it is the same boat. How can the boat be the same boat—the riddle runs—if every physical element of the original has been replaced?
The answer is that the “boat” is not made of planks but of the relationship between planks. If you hammer a hundred strips of wood atop each other, you get a wall; if you nail them side to side, you get a deck; only a particular configuration of planks, held together in particular relationship, in a particular order, makes a boat.
Genes operate in the same manner. Individual genes specify individual functions, but the relationship among genes allows physiology.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Mukherjee, Siddhartha. “The Gene.” Scribner. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“Seek simplicity, but distrust it,” Alfred North Whitehead, the mathematician and philosopher, once advised his students.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Coyle, Daniel. “The Culture Code.” Bantam, 2018-01-30. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“I’m giving you these comments because I have very high expectations and I know that you can reach them”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: Coyle, Daniel. “The Culture Code.” Bantam, 2018-01-30. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“Here’s a handy use of this effect: Thinking about your ancestors makes you smarter. A research team led by Peter Fischer found that spending a few minutes contemplating your family tree (as opposed to contemplating a friend, or a shopping list, or nothing at all) significantly boosted performance on tests of cognitive intelligence. Their hypothesis is that thinking about our connections to the group increases our feelings of autonomy and control.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: John Lewis Gaddis. “On Grand Strategy.” Penguin Books, 2018-04-03T03:00:00+00:00. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“The prudent leader “dreads and reflects on everything that can happen to him but is bold when he is in the thick of action.” Xerxes listens patiently, but objects that “if you were to take account of everything . . . , you would never do anything. It is better to have a brave heart and endure one half of the terrors we dread than to [calculate] all of the terrors and suffer nothing at all. . . . Big things are won by big dangers.”</p></blockquote><p>Excerpt From: John Lewis Gaddis. “On Grand Strategy.” Penguin Books, 2018-04-03T03:00:00+00:00. Apple Books.</p><blockquote><p>“By way of an Oxford party, an Archilochus fragment, and Tolstoy’s epic, Berlin had stumbled upon two of the very best ways to become intellectually indelible. The first is to be Delphic, a trick known to oracles throughout time. The second is to be Aesopian: turn your ideas into animals, and they’ll achieve immortality”</p></blockquote></div></div><div id=footer class=mb-5><hr><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://goodmattg.github.io><small>By Matthew Goodman</small></a></div></div></body></html>
