My name is Matt Goodman. I'm a recent grad from the The University of Pennsylvania where I studied Electrical Engineering. My interests have always varied widely: signal processing, political science, Longhorns football, art, finance, and yes, technology. The content of this blog will reflect the fact that I find boring subjects to be really interesting.
