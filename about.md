My name is Matthew Goodman. I currently work at Qualtrics as a Software Engineer where my team works on the platform backing our heavily trafficked 2K QPS product. I graduated from the The University of Pennsylvania in 2017 where I majored in Electrical Engineering and pursued minors in Math and Computer Science. My interests are varied: deep learning for computer vision, reinforcement learning, probability theory, functional programming, signal processing, political science, philosophy, history, trading, network theory, foreign policy, art, design, finance, and the general nitty gritty of technology. The content of this blog will reflect the fact that, while I am by no means an expert in any of these subjects, I'm consistently gaining knowledge in them by the day.
