My name is Matt Goodman. I'm a recent grad from the The University of Pennsylvania where I majored in Electrical Engineering and pursued minors in Math and Computer Science. My interests are varied: signal processing, political science, philosophy, history, trading, machine learning, network theory, foreign policy, art, design, finance, and yes, technology. The content of this blog will reflect the fact that I'm consistently learning in a number of subjects.
