## Motivation

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

This post encapsulates the work I undertook with Dean Fulgoni for our final project in Big Data Analytics. Credit to Professor Chris Callison-Burch for steering me away from some topics that could easily be Phd theses and to Professor Zach Ives for being an excellent teacher.

## The Problem We Tried to Solve

This was all to win a Quora competition. The question is deviously simple - given two input questions, tell whether they ask the same thing.

1. Is breast cancer preventable?
2. How do I prevent breast cancer?

Imagining a system or model that could answer this question correctly every time, we knew we would need to quantify semantic similarity and syntactic similarity.

- Grammar lends structure to

There are so many problems with the system we wanted to build that I’ll address in a later section. As a teaser, consider that

## Lesson Learned, Hardly Earned

## If We Only Had More Time

I would have worked on:

- Grammars: Quora’s user base can be divided into Indian subcontinent and the United States. This matters because we don’t expect perfect grammar from people whose first language isn’t English. Can we detect
