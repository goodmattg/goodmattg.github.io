_Range_ is a must-read for anyone in the early stages of their career that feels anxiety seeing friends around them rocket to the top of a narrow sub-domain. The good news is that a bright future awaits generalists later in their careers. The generalists are able to make leaps out of their narrow sub-domains, drawing on ideas from fields that would look on the surface as having nothing to do with their current problem, but yet, as it turns out do share the same substructure. I love this book because it reminds you that, yes, you can be great at things you didn't start practicing when you were four. However, I think Epstein doesn't spend enough time exploring why generalists are disappearing in our late-stage capitalist world. This isn't a personal book. Epstein may credit that students are forced to specialize early, but he isn't really thinking about the emotional and psychological side of early-specialization.
