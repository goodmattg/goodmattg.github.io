Professor Scott Galloway's treatise on the four tech giants of our age is incendiary and prophetic. I blitzed through Galloway's book on a flight from Austin to New York and couldn't escape the thought that my life is textbook confirmation of his thesis. I read The Four on an iPad during a flight that I priced with Google. I had just purchased a bunch of basics in bulk for my new apartment from Amazon on a MacBook. Facebook should go without saying - I'm under 25, so I compulsively check Messenger and Instagram. The Four almost exclusively dominate my interactions with my friends, peers, and family. And while this should be cause for privacy concerns, I likely won't act until the risks, which are not readily apparent, outweigh the enormous benefits. We pay for free connection, free search, and the ability to cheaply acquire every product in existence with our data. It's easy react negatively to handing over so much data to large companies: "it's my data, how dare they monetize it ...." but that's quite literally the price of free services. Where I get angry is when legacy companies acquire my data, usually from shady third party data providers - hotels, credit agencies, etc. Legacy companies = terrible security. They don't have the vested interest or the technical ability to maintain a state-of-the-art security operation. At least Google has never suffered a major data breach. It speaks to my biases/preferences/experience, but when I rent a storage unit my main concern is that the unit is secure from theft. I rarely consider if the storage proprietor has checked to see what I have stored in the locker. And a key technical point to remember in the case of every digital storage provider is that any these companies don't just stored your data in plain sight. There isn't a file of "Matt_personal_data.txt" on a database somewhere. This information is all encrypted and then sharded a thousand ways to Sunday because the companies themselves have a vested interest to protect your data from adversaries.

There are other lessons about life and career management that are common to this family of book. They are well argued in the book (see quotes below).

> “Sectors are asset classes—the cool ones are overinvested, driving down returns on human capital (compensation for working there). If you want to work for Vogue, produce films, or open a restaurant, you had better get immense psychological reward from your gig, as the comp, and returns on your efforts, will likely suck. Competition will be fierce, and even if you manage to get in, you’ll be easily replaceable, as there are always younger, hipper candidates nipping at your heels.”

> “The slope of the trajectory for your career is (unfairly) set the first five years post-graduation. If you want the trajectory to be steep, you’ll need to burn a lot of fuel. The world is not yours for the taking, but for the trying. Try hard, really hard.”
